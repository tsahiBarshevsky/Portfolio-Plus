# Portfolio Plus
Creating a portfolio has never been so easy!

### So, what is Portfolio Plus?
Portfolio Plus is a web application that allows everyone to create a  designed landing page with all of their personal projects and works.
The idea was born out of a need to unify all projects in one place, which will be a slightly less generic and banal way as in a resume, but in a readable, colorful and eye-catching way.

### Some technical details about this web app:

* The backend (authentication and storage) created with Firebase and Cloud Firestore.
* The code has written using Visual Studio Code.
* I've been using React, Material-UI, styled components and some other npm packages, like:
  * Firebase
  * react-dom
  * react-router-dom
  * framer-motion
  * react-scroll
